# Prosodic Event Detection with Classical ML

## Overview
End-to-end pipeline for detecting prosodic prominence and boundaries in speech
using traditional machine learning approaches.

## Features
- Robust audio preprocessing with librosa
- Frame-level feature extraction (F0, energy, MFCCs)
- Comprehensive model comparison (9 algorithms)
- Production-ready evaluation pipeline

## Results
- **Prominence**: F1 = 0.47-0.48 (strong baseline)
- **Boundary**: F1 = 0.12-0.13 (more challenging task)
- Models generalize well across speakers

## Next Steps
- Experimenting with LLMs, fine-tuning models for improved performance
